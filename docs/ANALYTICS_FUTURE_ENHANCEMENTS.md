# Analytics: Future Enhancements (Non-Blocking)

This document outlines planned, non-breaking enhancements to the analytics/insights layer. These items improve i18n, formatting consistency, and reduce duplicated config resolution in callers.

Scope: documentation only. No behavior change yet.

---

1) Transition InsightOutput to StructuredInsight[] integrated with i18n

Current state
- InsightOutput = string[] (see src/types/insights.ts).
- StructuredInsight type already exists but is not the primary output.

Goal
- Migrate InsightOutput => StructuredInsight[] and render insights using react-i18next with params for interpolation.

Proposed shape
- src/types/insights.ts already defines:
  - interface StructuredInsight { key: string; params?: Record<string, unknown>; severity?: 'info' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'danger' }

i18n keys
- Namespace: analytics
- Keys: analytics.insight.* (keep stable, composable names)
  - analytics.insight.patternDetected
  - analytics.insight.limitedData
  - analytics.insight.noTrackingData
  - analytics.insight.highCorrelation
  - analytics.insight.trendIncreasing
  - analytics.insight.trendDecreasing

Examples
- { key: 'analytics.insight.patternDetected', params: { pattern: 'morning-anxiety', confidence: 0.78 }, severity: 'warning' }
- { key: 'analytics.insight.limitedData', params: { sessions: 3, min: 5 }, severity: 'info' }

UI integration
- Components resolve copy via tAnalytics(key, params) and style by severity.
- Severity mapping suggestion:
  - info => neutral/secondary emphasis
  - success => positive/green tokens (paired with icon per a11y rule)
  - warning => amber/orange emphasis
  - danger => destructive/red emphasis

Migration plan (incremental)
- Step A: Dual output behind a feature flag in generateInsights: build StructuredInsight[] in parallel with existing strings; keep strings as the returned type to avoid UI churn.
- Step B: Add render adapters in UI panels (EnhancedPersonalizedInsights, PatternsPanel) that accept either string[] or StructuredInsight[].
- Step C: Flip default to StructuredInsight[] and deprecate plain strings.

Acceptance criteria
- All user-facing copy comes from analytics namespace (see rule hbuFGtAy...).
- No hardcoded text in insights logic; only i18n keys + params.
- Tests cover key presence in both nb and en locales for new insight keys.

2) Centralize percent formatting and date utilities

Context
- We already provide locale-aware format helpers from the translation hook (useTranslation): formatDate, formatDateTime, formatNumber.

Plan
- Add a small formatting helper that wraps NumberFormat percent style consistently and re-export date helpers from the hook where needed. Do not introduce new global date utils; prefer existing helpers to honor active language (see rule E9BuTDKV...).

Suggested utility API (non-breaking proposal)
- src/lib/format.ts
  - export function formatPercent(value: number, digits: number = 0, localeFrom?: string): string
    - Uses Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: 'percent', minimumFractionDigits: digits, maximumFractionDigits: digits })
  - Re-export or import useTranslation().formatDate / formatDateTime in components and worker adapters where needed.

Usage guidance
- In UI: call const { formatDate, formatDateTime } = useTranslation(); then use directly.
- In non-React modules (workers/logic): accept locale as a parameter or resolve via config -> pass to formatPercent.

Acceptance criteria
- No ad-hoc toFixed() percent formatting in analytics.
- Dates and percent representations are stable across UI and exports.

3) Single generateAnalyticsSummary wrapper to reduce duplicate config resolution

Problem
- Multiple callers independently invoke analyticsConfig.getConfig(), calculate metrics, and generate insights, increasing overhead and risk of drift.

Proposal
- Introduce a single façade function that: resolves config once, runs calculations, composes insights, and returns a compact, cache-friendly summary.

Proposed API (non-breaking)
- Location: src/lib/insights/unified.ts (or new src/lib/analyticsSummary.ts)
- export interface AnalyticsSummary {
    insights: StructuredInsight[] | string[]; // dual during migration
    confidence: number;
    hasMinimumData: boolean;
    tags?: string[]; // for cache invalidation
    computedAt: string; // ISO
  }
- export async function generateAnalyticsSummary(inputs: {
    entries: TrackingEntry[];
    emotions: EmotionEntry[];
    sensoryInputs: SensoryEntry[];
    goals?: Goal[];
  }, options?: { useStructuredInsights?: boolean; locale?: 'nb' | 'en'; cfg?: AnalyticsConfiguration }): Promise<AnalyticsSummary>

Implementation notes
- Internally, call computeInsights (src/lib/insights/unified.ts) which already centralizes config fallback; surface only the subset needed by UI.
- Respect rule j9uSCDpf...: never hardcode thresholds; always read via analyticsConfig.
- Keep payload small per bpP9eeEv...: send partial/progress/complete envelopes if this runs in a worker.

Acceptance criteria
- Call sites need only one import to get summary (optional migration).
- Verified no duplicate analyticsConfig.getConfig() calls in hot paths.

---

Open questions / decisions
- Should severity be strictly derived by rule confidence/thresholds or set by individual rules? Recommendation: derive via normalized score bands in config to keep consistent UI emphasis.
- Where to house formatting helpers used by workers (no React)? Recommendation: small pure helpers in src/lib/format.ts that accept a locale string, while UI continues to use useTranslation() for date/number.

Testing considerations
- Add unit tests that:
  - Assert structured insight keys exist in locales.
  - Verify severity mapping logic with boundary conditions.
  - Validate formatPercent against nb-NO and en-US.
  - Ensure generateAnalyticsSummary resolves config once per call (spy on analyticsConfig.getConfig()).

Non-goals (for now)
- Changing storage schemas or cache keys.
- Introducing new ML providers or model configs.

Rollout
- Behind a feature flag in config.features (e.g., enableStructuredInsights, enableSummaryFacade) defaulting to false.
