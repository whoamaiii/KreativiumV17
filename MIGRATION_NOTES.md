# Migration from kreativiumbeta2

## Import Summary

This commit represents the import of the kreativiumbeta2 project into the KreativiumV17 repository.

## What was Imported

### Core Application
- `dist/` - Complete built application ready for deployment
- `dist/index.html` - Main application entry point
- `dist/robots.txt` - Search engine directives

### AI/ML Components
- `dist/models/gemma3-270m-it/` - Gemma model configuration
- Worker files for analytics, AI processing, and reports

### Configuration
- `.gitignore` - Updated to exclude large binary files
- `.husky/` - Git hooks configuration

## What was Excluded

### Large Binary Files
- `*.onnx` model files (too large for git)
- `*.bin` and `*.safetensors` files
- WASM runtime files

### Development Environment
- `node_modules/` directory
- Python virtual environment (`mlx-backend/venv/`)

### Generated Files
- Build artifacts that can be regenerated
- Temporary files and logs

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Download required model files
4. Configure ML backend
5. Test deployment

## Notes

- The original project was connected to `Kreativiumv18Gemma.git`
- This import preserves the essential application structure
- Large files will need to be downloaded separately for full functionality
